class CommandHandler(common.AbstractCommandHandler):
    """Handle incoming commands and send replies. Apply configuration and read
    sensor data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    callback : `Callable`
        The callback coroutine handling the sensor telemetry. This can be a
        coroutine that sends the data via a socket connection or a coroutine in
        a test class to verify that the command has been handled correctly.
    simulation_mode : `int`
        Indicating if a simulation mode (> 0) or not (0) is active.
        Simulation mode 0 means "connect to the real sensors."
        Set simulation_mode to 1 to enable simulation mode and connect to a
        mock sensor.

    The commands that can be handled are:

        configure: Load the configuration that is passed on with the command
        and connect to the devices specified in that configuration. This
        command can be sent multiple times before a start is received and only
        the last configuration is kept.
        start: Start reading the sensor data of the connected devices and send
        it as plain text via the socket. If no configuration was sent then the
        start command is ignored. Once started no configuration changes can be
        done anymore.
        stop: Stop sending sensor data and disconnect from all devices. Once
        stopped, configuration changes can be done again and/or reading of
        sensor data can be started again.

        Parameters
        ----------
        device_configuration : `dict`
            A dict representing the device to connect to. The format of the
            dict follows the configuration of the ts_ess_csc project.
        devices_in_error_state : `bool`
            Whether the devices are in error state (True) or not (False,
            default). To be used by unit tests.

        Returns
        -------
        device : `common.device.BaseDevice`
            The device to connect to.

        Raises
        ------
        RuntimeError
            In case an incorrect configuration has been loaded.

        Notes
        -----
        In case simulation_mode is set to 1, only the sensor type is
        used and a mock device is instantiated.
        In case a serial device is specified, the device will only be
        instantiated if the code is running on a Raspberry Pi.
        In all other cases, the architecture of the platform is
        irrelevant.
