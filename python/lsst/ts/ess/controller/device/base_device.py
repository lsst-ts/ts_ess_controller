    This class holds all common code for the hardware devices. Device specific

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: `str`
        The name of the device.
    device_id: `str`
        The hardware device ID to connect to. This can be a physical ID (e.g.
        /dev/ttyUSB0), a serial port (e.g. serial_ch_1) or any other ID used by
        the specific device.
    sensor: `BaseSensor`
        The sensor that produces the telemetry.
    callback_func : `Callable`
        Callback function to receive the telemetry.
    log: `logging.Logger`
        The logger to create a child logger for.
