    """Temperature Sensor.

    Perform protocol conversion for RTD thermal sensors. Serial data is output
    by the instrument once per second with the following format:

        'C00=0010.1100,C01=0009.9896<\r><\n>'

    where:

        C00=        First channel temperature prefix.
        -dddd.dddd  Temperature value.
        C01=        Second channel temperature prefix.
        -dddd.dddd  Temperature value.
        <LF><CR>    2-character terminator ('\n\r').

    The values only show a sign in case of a negative value. The number of
    channels determines the exact telemetry string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log: `logger`
        The logger for which to create a child logger.
    num_channels: `int`
        The number of temperature channels.
